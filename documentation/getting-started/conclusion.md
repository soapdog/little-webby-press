# Final Remarks and Moving On

This has been a long read. Most of it has been on explaining the _book configuration file_, which looks way more complex than what it is. If this is the first time you're seeing a file like this, let me reassure you that with time, familliarity will make them boring and simple in your eyes. They are always very similar between books. Once you made one for a book, you'll find making the next one basically a case of copying and pasting and replacing the values.

In this getting started, we haven't explored all the options that you have available for that configuration file, we only guided you through the options that were used for our Moby Dick sample. To learn more about all options available to you, check out the [Book Configuration File Specification](https://little.webby.press/documentation/en/book-configuration/).
