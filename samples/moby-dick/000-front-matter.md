Etymology (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School)
--------------------------------------------------------------------


The pale Usher — threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now. He
was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief,
mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the
world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his
mortality.

“While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a
whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out, through ignorance, the
letter H, which almost alone maketh the signification of the word, you deliver
that which is not true.”  — *Hackluyt*

> __WHALE__.... Sw. and Dan. __HVAL__. This animal is named from roundness or
> rolling; for in Dan. __HVALT__ is arched or vaulted. — *Webster’s

> __WHALE__.... It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. __WALLEN__; A.S.
__WALW-IAN__, to roll, to wallow. — *Richardson’s _Dictionary_*

Extracts (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian)
------------------------------------------

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor
devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and
street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he
could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must
not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements,
however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from
it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a
glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.

So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever
warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one
sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon
tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not
altogether unpleasant sadness — Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more
pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go
thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye!
But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for
your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your
coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together — there, ye shall strike
unsplinterable glasses!

“We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The
Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that is a
fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a
whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains....  I was told of a
whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly....
One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that
was white all over.” — *_A Voyage to Greenland, AD 1671._ Harris Coll.*

“Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) _Anno 1652_, one eighty feet
in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was informed), besides a

a gate in the garden of Pitferren. ” — *Sibbald’s _Fife and Kinross._*

“Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this Sperma-ceti whale,

his fierceness and swiftness.” — *Richard Strafford’s _Letter from the
Bermudas._ Phil. Trans. AD 1668.*

“Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.” — *_N. E. Primer._*

“The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so great dread
of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their
names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and some other articles of the
same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near
approach.” — *Uno Von Troil’s _Letters On Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to

(Somewhere.)

“A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on the
consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers,
is the right to royal fish, which are whale and sturgeon.  And these, when
either thrown ashore or caught near the coast, are the property of the king.” —
*Blackstone.*

> Up-spouted by a whale in air,   
> To express unwieldy joy.

> Had never seen; from dread Leviathan    
> To insect millions peopling every wave:

> Led by mysterious instincts through that waste    
> And trackless region, though on every side    
> Assaulted by voracious enemies,

whale.’” — *_Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Whale Ship Essex of Nantucket,

> The wind was piping free;

> As it floundered in the sea.    
> — *Elizabeth Oakes Smith.*

“The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this
one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles....

“Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which, cracking like
a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four miles.” — *Scoresby*

“Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the infuriated Sperm
Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide expanded
jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with his head; they
are propelled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly
destroyed.... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the
habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an
animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should
have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent
observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the
most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.” — *Thomas Beale’s
_History of the Sperm Whale,_ 1839*

“The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the True Whale”
(Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon at either
extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ
these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and
mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of
all the known species of the whale tribe.” — *Frederick Debell Bennett’s
_Whaling Voyage Round the Globe,_ 1840*

the Globe,” by Lay and Hussey Survivors.  AD 1828*

“Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded, he parried the assault for
some time with a lance; but the furious monster at length rushed on the boat;
himself and comrades only being preserved by leaping into the water when they
saw the onset was inevitable.” — *_Missionary Journal_ of Tyerman and Bennett*

“Nantucket itself,” said Mr. Webster, “is a very striking and peculiar portion
of the National interest. There is a population of eight or nine thousand
persons living here in the sea, adding largely every year to the National wealth
by the boldest and most persevering industry.” — *Report of Daniel Webster’s
Speech in the U. S. Senate, on the application for the erection of a breakwater
at Nantucket. 1828*

possible, to discover a passage through it to India, though they failed of their

Dictionary_*

“These things are reciprocal; the ball rebounds, only to bound forward again;
for now in laying open the haunts of the whale, the whalemen seem to have
indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West Passage.” — *From
_“Something”_ unpublished*

“It is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being struck by her
near appearance. The vessel under short sail, with look-outs at the mast-heads,
eagerly scanning the wide expanse around them, has a totally different air from
those engaged in regular voyage.” — *_Currents and Whaling._ U.S. Ex. Ex*

“Pedestrians in the vicinity of London and elsewhere may recollect having seen
large curved bones set upright in the earth, either to form arches over
gateways, or entrances to alcoves, and they may perhaps have been told that
these were the ribs of whales.” — *_Tales of a Whale Voyager to the Arctic

his tail.” — *A chapter on whaling in _Ribs and Trucks_*
