# Using JSON

Besides TOML and YAML, you can also use [JSON](https://json.org) for the configuration file. If you're more familiar with JSON than with the other languages, and would rather not leave your confort zone, we got you covered. Just name your file `Book.json` and write the equivalent JSON.

## Why We Prefer TOML over JSON

This is just a personal opinion, you're free to have a different take on this matter. For me TOML is more pleasant to write as I don't need to keep balancing brackets, quotes, and commas. I also find TOML less noisy than JSON. An important aspect that played a huge factor in my choice of using TOML over JSON, was that it is easier to copy and paste whole TOML sections than it is to copy chunks of JSON. For sections you're going to end up reusing over and over again, such as `[author]`, using TOML reduces the chance of bugs originating from copy and paste workflows.

## Sample configuration using JSON

This is a JSON version of the configuration for the _Moby Dick_ sample.

The quest is an obsession and the novel is a diabolical study of how a man becomes a fanatic.But it is also a hymn to democracy. Bent as the crew is on Ahab's appalling crusade, it is equally the image of a co-operative community at work: all hands dependent on all hands, each individual responsible for the security of each.Among the crew is Ishmael, the novel's narrator, ordinary sailor, and extraordinary reader. Digressive, allusive, vulgar, transcendent, the story Ishmael tells is above all an education:in the practice of whaling, in the art of writing. Expanding to equal his 'mighty theme' - not only the whale but all things sublime - Melville breathes in the world's great literature. Moby Dick is the greatest novel ever written by an American.\n"
